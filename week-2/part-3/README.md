# Week 2 Part 3

## Learning Objective: Build Demo Website

Even though you would like to be a backend engineer, you should build a basic user interface for demonstration. 

#### There are 4 pages await to be completed. Take a look at all of them:

1. Home Page - `/index.html`
2. Product Page - `/product.html`
3. Thank You Page - `/thankyou.html`
4. Profile Page - `/profile.html`

#### What do we have?

1. There are 3 well-designed pages from our designer. We should follow those designs.  
Refer to: https://app.zeplin.io/project/5b5007688474a1a77c003931

2. There are logo and icons ready.

3. Get data from your own backend APIs.

#### What should we do?

1. Page Layout.
2. Check Out Procedure.
3. User Sign Up and Sign In.

### Complete Home Page Layout

Today, you only need to build the static home page (`/index.html`) layout without effects or actions. You only need to render the data received from `https://[HOST_NAME]/api/[API_VERSION]/products/all` and you don't need to consider the issue of different pages here.
