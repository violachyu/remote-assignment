# Week 3 Part 2

## Stabilization and Optimization

I guess you are in a big mess now, but it's quite a chance to make everything better.  
Check the list below to review and optimize your code and database.
1. Is there any code block repeating again and again in your system?
2. Did you verify all the request inputs before you use them in a critical procedure?
3. Did you give proper error message back to client when something goes wrong?
4. Did you setup primary key for every database table?
5. Did you define the proper data type for every table column?
6. Is your database designed with a good extensibility?

The last question is: do you really know what you have done in the past 3 weeks?

## Domain Name Network

I strongly recommend you to buy a domain name and setup for your website. It will help you understand the Domain Name Network ecosystem.
